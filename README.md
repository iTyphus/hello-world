What am i even doing?

Alright, so I am hyper-new to coding at this point, like actually zero experience. I was thinking about things for lifew and college and a job or profession or whatever, and I could not really come up with something that would be exciting, fulfilling, and feasible. I always had this type of idea in the back of my mind, but I had always thought how some poeple would always just be better and that there might not even be a point if I can't become great at this. But then I thought for about a microsecond more and realized that everyone who is good at coding or programming started from a blank slate. Some people are more athletic or taller or stronger or even geniuses, but I am very sure that there are basically no people birthed with innate knowledge of coding. We all start this on an even playing field, but even still I plan on becomign one of the "best" if that even is a thing in this field. Cannot wait to work with other people with as much of a passion as I have!!
